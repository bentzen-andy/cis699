            <strong>Hazard Pay</strong>
            <div>
              This week I plugged away a on a few updates for my FPS game.{" "}
            </div>
            <br />
            <div>
              I spent some time getting Unity set up on my Windows machine since
              it has a bigger screen and it's just easier to work on compared to
              my MacBook. So I rebuilt the project and made some additions. I'm
              also trying to be thoughtful about how I'm writing my code (as
              opposed to blindly following the tutorial). For instance, I
              borrowed from a different tutorial to create my player movement
              scripts. I really liked the pattern that Brackey used for player
              movement. So now I have to be thoughtful about how to add to my
              code, since my code base doesn't line up perfectly with my current
              tutorial on Udemy. It takes a little extra work to think though
              the problem, but I like that better anyway because it forces me to
              keep my brain in the driver's seat.
            </div>
            <br />

            <div>
              As far as my current progress, here's what I have done so far and
              what's next.

              <li>Running (hold shift)</li>
              <li>Movement bobbing animation (as the player is walking)</li>
              <li>Jumping (spacebar)</li>

                Shooting (likely with raycasting) I may try some slow-moving
                projectiles as well.
